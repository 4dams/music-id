![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28960614/221184940-429415da-6866-472d-9058-d8267b922ae9.png)

Music ID is a service that automatically detects music running in Twitch streams. This is useful for Twitch streamers and viewers who want to know what music is being played during a stream. The service runs in the background and identifies music in real-time, so users don't have to manually search for the music being played!

[» Get Started!](https://music-id.live)

### Features

-   Real-Time Music Identification
-   Fully Automatic Identifications
-   Provided as a Setup and Forget-Service
-   No Need to Install or Run Local Software
-   Provided 100% Free of Charge

### Installation

There is no installation required to use Music ID! It is provided as a service, meaning both the streamer and their viewers don't have to install or update anything. Simply visit the [Music ID website](https://music-id.live), connect your Twitch account, and Music ID will start running in the background.

### Usage

Once Music ID is running, it will automatically identify any music that is playing during a Twitch stream. Users can find out what song is being played by asking in the chat. Music ID automatically detects if a user wants to know what song is being played, so all they have to do is ask in chat! Here are some examples:

-   "What's the song?"
-   "What song is currently playing?"
-   "!song"

Music ID will respond in chat with the name of the song, the artist, and a link to the song on a supported music service. This makes it easy for users to discover new music while watching Twitch streams.

### Repository Information

This repository does not contain the source code of the actual identification part as that's currently being kept private. This repository will soon contain the documentation and implementation of a dedicated Music ID API for developers.
