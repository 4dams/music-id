## Description

**Music ID for Twitch** is a Chat Bot that automatically identifies music running in the background of [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/) Streams, VODs, and Clips.

The Bot originally started as a school project in [PSZileans Channel](https://twitch.tv/ratirl) and was intended to run for about two weeks to collect various data points to analyze later on. However, the project gained so much positive feedback that I decided to keep it running. Today, [TwitchMusicID](https://twitch.tv/twitchmusicid) is part of **more than 500 Twitch Channels** and received almost **one million identification requests** which about **85% were successful**.

## Live Example

## Add the Bot

If you want to use **Music ID for Twitch** in your Twitch Channel, please visit [adams.sh/twitch](https://adams.sh/twitch) and follow the instructions there. The setup is 100% automatic and will allow you to add the Bot to your Channel in no time!

## Manage the Bot

Previously, the Bot was managed solely through its GraphQL API. However, since January 2021, **Music ID for Twitch** now has its own management dashboard which you can find over at [id.adams.sh](https://music-id.adams.sh).
